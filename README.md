# Changed, enhanced, modified components
This repository contains all OS components we have modified/improved or somehow changed. It will be used as the place to publish/find all sources and data, which we might be obliged to publish.
In general all components remain with their original license. For some we might publish only the information about the changes we have made, for some we will publish the sources as well. However, this is just a "bin" to confirm with our legal obligations resulting from any kind of downstream obligations. We always offer the original project to pull our changes. Thus it might happen, that later versions do contain our changes, which in return
However, we tend to keep the license of the component's author(s). Thus our changes typically come under the same license as the unchanged, original component itself. Please refer to the appropriate source for further details.
